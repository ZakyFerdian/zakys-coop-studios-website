Full Detailed Steps to Fix "No applicable app licenses found" Error in Minecraft Launcher üõ†Ô∏èüíÄ

1. Uninstall Minecraft and Minecraft Launcher:

Open Settings (Press Win + I).

Navigate to Apps > Apps & Features.

Find Minecraft and Minecraft Launcher in the list.

Click on each and select Uninstall.

Confirm uninstallation for both.




2. Clear Store Cache:

Press Win + R to open the Run dialog.

Type wsreset.exe and hit Enter. (This will open a blank command prompt window, clear the Microsoft Store cache, and close automatically after it‚Äôs done).

Wait for the process to complete.



3. Enable Hidden Folders to View WindowsApps Folder:

Open File Explorer (Win + E).

Go to the View tab at the top.

Check the Hidden items checkbox to make hidden files and folders visible.

Go to C:\Program Files and search for the WindowsApps folder. It may not be visible unless you‚Äôve enabled hidden folders.



4. Reset WindowsApps Permissions (If Needed):

Right-click on the WindowsApps folder (if you see it) and click on Properties.

Go to the Security tab.

If it‚Äôs locked, click Edit to change permissions, or click Advanced and change the owner to Your Username if necessary.

Once you have access, try deleting it or fixing permissions if it's causing issues with app licenses.



5. Reinstall the Xbox App:

Open Microsoft Store (Win + S, then type Microsoft Store).

In the store, search for Xbox App.

Click Install (if it's not installed already) or Repair if you see the option (you may need to click the 3 dots next to the Xbox app and select Repair).

This will make sure your system has the proper integration with Xbox services.



6. Reinstall Gaming Services:

In the Microsoft Store, search for Gaming Services.

Click Install or Repair if it's already installed.

This is important because Gaming Services is critical for Minecraft to work properly, especially if you're using the Xbox/Microsoft version of the game.




7. Reinstall the Minecraft Launcher (Fresh Installation):

Go to the official Minecraft Website and download the latest Minecraft Launcher installer.

Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install the launcher.

This is a fresh copy, so it‚Äôll ensure there are no broken files from the previous installation.


Once installed, launch the Minecraft Launcher and log in using your Microsoft account.



8. Reset Minecraft Launcher (If You Still Have Issues):

Open Settings (Press Win + I).

Go to Apps > Apps & Features.

Find the Minecraft Launcher and click on it.

Select Advanced options and then click Reset.

This will reset the app without affecting your saved games or settings but will fix any potential issues in the app's data.




9. Check for Windows Updates:

Open Settings again and go to Update & Security.

Click Check for updates and let Windows automatically download and install any available updates.

Sometimes missing or outdated system files can cause issues with app installations.




10. Reboot the System:

After all these steps, restart your laptop to ensure that everything is working properly and all services are reloaded.

This will help clear out any temporary issues that may be affecting the Minecraft Launcher.



11. Final Check:

Once everything‚Äôs updated, open the Minecraft Launcher and log in with your Microsoft account.

The error should be resolved, and you should be able to play Minecraft without issues.
